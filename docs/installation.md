# Native installation

The guided commands described here are v1.0 work built on the proven v0.9.0 native deployment.
Read [migration](rename-migration.md) before changing an existing deployment.

Target: Raspberry Pi OS Trixie, 64-bit ARM, Python 3.13, systemd and BlueZ. Docker is not used.
Clean installation and reboot recovery passed on this target. Do not install during
an active cook.

## Before installing

These are fresh-install instructions. For an existing managed installation, use
[upgrade and rollback](upgrade-and-rollback.md) instead; do not reinstall over it.
If migrating from an experimental setup, preserve its files as a separate fallback
and stop its process before connecting the managed service. Never run two instances
against the same thermometer or terminate arbitrary Python processes.

Install Git to obtain the reviewed source from GitHub. The guided installer checks and classifies
all other packages, explains missing required dependencies and asks before installing them. The
default response is No.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

Clone the private repository using an authenticated, least-privilege GitHub identity.
Check out the reviewed release tag or full commit, verify it, and install from the
component directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:moodywaters/pitblu.git
cd pitblu
git checkout --detach REPLACE_WITH_REVIEWED_TAG_OR_FULL_COMMIT
git rev-parse HEAD
git status --short
cd pitblu-core
./pitblu-core-install
```

Do not place GitHub tokens in command arguments or shell history. A source archive
from the same reviewed GitHub revision remains valid for offline recovery, but
GitHub is the normal source of release truth.

Use `./pitblu-core-install check` for a non-mutating prerequisite report. Required packages are
labelled runtime/install or deployment. `curl` is optional and `mosquitto-clients` is
acceptance/test-only. Mosquitto and `mosquitto-clients` are optional broker and acceptance packages,
not pitblu-core runtime prerequisites. The gateway can operate with MQTT disabled.
When MQTT is required, provision an authenticated local, remote or hosted broker
separately.

The guided command remains unprivileged and explains each escalation. It delegates the actual
deployment to `deploy/manage.sh`, which creates a system account `pitblu-core` with no login shell,
adds it to the existing
`bluetooth` group, creates a new permanent virtual environment in a versioned release directory,
and installs the package there. It requires package-index access. Application source is trusted
code: review it before running the installer as root. It does not modify Mosquitto configuration.

Save the one-time administrator token in a password manager. Do not paste it into chat, command
arguments or logs. The installer refuses redirected output; SQLite stores only a salted scrypt
hash. On ordinary service startup, a missing token or disabled authentication causes failure,
never token generation into journald. Initial settings are loopback, port 8080, token authentication,
physical BLE and MQTT disabled. Configure MQTT through the API after onboarding.

The installer offers to enable/start the service and then verifies service state, installed version,
health and Bluetooth. If starting was declined, start explicitly when ready:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now pitblu-core
systemctl is-active pitblu-core
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

The service deliberately does not connect to unregistered devices. Run `pitblu-core-config igrill`
or use the guided menu to register it. `pitblu-core-config check` is the canonical verification and
support command. The low-level REST
[onboarding workflow](frontend-integration.md#4-discovery-registration-and-connection-workflow)
remains available to integration developers.
Existing databases are not imported automatically. Configure secrets through the
write-only API over loopback. Token rotation is
authenticated through the existing API. A lost initial token requires a planned local recovery,
not deleting the production database.

## Files and privileges

- `/opt/pitblu-core/releases/release-*/venv`: root-owned installed code, readable but not writable
  by the service. Virtual environments never move; `/opt/pitblu-core/current` selects one.
- `/etc/pitblu-core/config.yaml`: root-owned non-secret startup configuration, mode 0640.
- `/etc/pitblu-core/environment`: root-owned optional systemd environment file, mode 0640.
- `/var/lib/pitblu-core/state.sqlite3`: service-owned administrative state, directory 0700,
  new files masked 0077. This includes the protected MQTT password; backups are secrets too.
- `/var/backups/pitblu-core`: root-only backups, retained until explicitly managed by the operator.

`PITBLU_CONFIG_FILE` selects YAML startup configuration. `PITBLU_DATABASE_PATH` selects SQLite.
`PITBLU_MANAGED=true` enables the service authentication guard. These startup controls are not
runtime configuration values. Persisted API overrides take precedence over YAML/environment.

The unit uses a read-only system filesystem, protected home directories, no added capabilities,
no privilege escalation and a private temporary directory. It allows local D-Bus plus IPv4/IPv6
and Bluetooth socket families. Bluetooth is accessed through BlueZ, not by granting root to the
gateway. Confirm the distribution's Bluetooth group access works; do not install broad D-Bus or
polkit exceptions without diagnosing an actual permission failure.

## Operation

```bash
pitblu-core-config check
systemctl status pitblu-core --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u pitblu-core -n 50 --no-pager
sudo systemctl restart pitblu-core
```

Restart interrupts readings. `Restart=on-failure` restarts a failed process after five seconds;
five rapid starts in a minute trigger a limit rather than an endless failure loop. After correcting
configuration, use `sudo systemctl reset-failed pitblu-core` then start it. Stopping the service
explicitly does not restart it. Shutdown has 45 seconds to drain HTTP, BLE and MQTT before systemd
terminates remaining processes. No automatic upgrades occur.

For trusted-LAN use, explicitly configure bind `0.0.0.0` with token authentication; plain HTTP is
trusted-LAN only. Never expose the API directly to the internet. The installer makes no firewall
changes. Validate reboot startup, BLE recovery and MQTT reception before relying on the service.

For normal installation and configuration examples, rerun and recovery guidance, dependency groups
and credential handling, see [guided terminal tools](terminal-tools.md). Direct
`sudo bash deploy/manage.sh ACTION` commands are the expert/recovery interface, not the normal first
installation path.
