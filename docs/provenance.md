# Provenance

Review performed on 4 September 2026. No source code was copied or substantially adapted. The
implementation is a clean expression of protocol facts that were compared across independent
sources.

aiomqtt installs Eclipse Paho MQTT Python 2.1.0 as its transport dependency. Paho declares
`EPL-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause`; this project relies on the BSD-3-Clause option. No aiomqtt or Paho source
was copied or adapted.

Dependency licences were reviewed from their project metadata or licence distributions. For the
v0.9.0 clean-Pi gate, the dependency inventory was generated on Linux/aarch64 with Python 3.13.5
using `pitblu-core/scripts/dependency_inventory.py` after installing the pinned Hatchling 1.32.0
build requirement. The valid JSON was checked for home and managed-state paths, authorisation
values, bearer tokens and password strings; none were found. This resolved-environment output
remains generated evidence rather than tracked source. CI produces and retains the normal
inventories for every supported Python version.

## Direct physical protocol evidence

On 4 September 2026, the target V202 supplied sanitised payloads `140080` for an inserted probe at a
simultaneous displayed 20°C, `30f880` for unplugged characteristics, `3c` for 60 per cent battery,
and `000a000002` for the characteristic previously described as a one-byte unit flag. These facts
were observed directly and were not copied from third-party source. The acceptance record contains
no Bluetooth address or personal network configuration.

The fixture records those bytes in `pitblu-core/tests/fixtures/v202/physical-proof.json` and replays them
through the clean-room protocol decoder. The production adapter, state machine, discovery
supervisor and simulator are original project code. No additional external source or dependency
was introduced for this milestone.

## Resilience provenance

The resilience implementation contains no copied/adapted third-party code. Recovery, lifecycle,
diagnostics and persistence changes use the existing dependency set and Python standard library.

The leftover-connection recovery helper invokes the existing BlueZ `bluetoothctl` executable
through bounded Python subprocess calls. No BlueZ code was copied or adapted. The behaviour
addresses direct Pi evidence: SIGKILL left a registered device connected and fresh discovery
could not restore application readings. BlueZ remains an operating-system prerequisite.

## Excluded source

`elupus/togrill-bluetooth` was not researched or used because it targets ToGrill-branded hardware,
not the Weber iGrill protocol.

## Native deployment

The deployment scripts, offline SQLite backup/token operations and unit file are original project
code. No third-party source was copied or adapted and no Python dependency was added. They invoke
the existing operating-system systemd, BlueZ, shadow account tools and util-linux flock/runuser
utilities. These remain installed system prerequisites rather than bundled source.
