# REST API

For a complete client-development handoff, see the
[frontend and AI integration guide](frontend-integration.md), including request and
response shapes, workflows, browser constraints and current implementation caveats.

The v1.0.0 release provides administration and current readings over REST.
Live events use [SSE](sse.md); optional broker telemetry uses [MQTT](mqtt.md).
OpenAPI and interactive documentation are generated at `/openapi.json` and
`/docs`. The package default listens only on `127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Authentication and errors

`GET /health` is always unauthenticated and returns only `{"status":"ok"}`. When `auth.mode` is
`token`, `/ready`, `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, `/redoc` and every `/api/v1/*`
resource require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Resource limits may return 429,
413 or 408; see the frontend guide for limits and retry behaviour.

Errors use one safe envelope with `code`, `message`, `correlationId` and optional redacted details.
The response repeats the correlation identifier in `X-Correlation-ID`. Request bodies and secret
values are never included in validation details.

## Resources

| Method and path | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health`, `GET /ready` | Minimal liveness and readiness. |
| `GET /api/v1/status` | Version, UTC time, process session ID, MQTT, host and device-worker status. |
| `GET /api/v1/diagnostics` | Same safe status result, including failure codes. |
| `GET /api/v1/events/operations` | Up to 100 persistent operational/configuration events. |
| `GET /api/v1/bluetooth` | Adapter availability, connection and physical/simulated source. |
| `POST /api/v1/scans` | Starts a scan operation and returns HTTP 202. |
| `GET /api/v1/scans/{scanId}` | Operation state and supported temporary discovery results. |
| `GET`, `POST /api/v1/devices` | Lists or registers explicitly selected devices. |
| `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE /api/v1/devices/{deviceId}` | Manages one registered device. |
| `POST /api/v1/devices/{deviceId}/{action}` | Starts `connect`, `disconnect` or `reconnect`; HTTP 202. |
| `GET /api/v1/devices/{deviceId}/probes` | Current probe state, including freshness. |
| `GET /api/v1/devices/{deviceId}/battery` | Current battery state, including freshness. |
| `GET /api/v1/operations[/{operationId}]` | Up to 100 recent persistent operation records. |
| `GET /api/v1/events` | Up to 100 recent canonical telemetry events. |
| `GET /api/v1/events/stream` | Live canonical events as `text/event-stream`. |
| `GET`, `PATCH /api/v1/config` | Describes or transactionally updates effective settings. |
| `GET /api/v1/config/schema` | Setting metadata and write-only secret status. |
| `POST /api/v1/config/validate` | Validates a proposed whole configuration without saving it. |
| `PUT`, `DELETE /api/v1/config/secrets/{name}` | Sets or removes an allowed write-only secret. |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/token/rotate` | Invalidates the old token and returns its replacement once. |

Registration accepts the opaque `discoveryId` from an authenticated scan response, an optional
`friendlyName`, `connect`, and `automaticReconnection`. This avoids putting a Bluetooth address in
ordinary REST payloads. A stable public `deviceId` is assigned and persisted.

Operation status is `queued`, `running`, `succeeded` or `failed`. Failures contain a stable safe
error code, never a raw Bleak error or address. API reads and repeated connection
requests are idempotent in their resulting state. An identical pending control returns its existing
operation. A conflicting pending control returns HTTP 409. Scan, connect, read and disconnect calls
share an adapter lock. Another registered device cannot acquire an already-owned adapter.

Registrations store protected hardware identity separately from public fields.
Automatic recovery never guesses identity from an advertised name. Registered
desired state and automatic-reconnection preference determine startup recovery. The current service restores one adapter owner at a time.

## Thermometer heartbeat

Device list and detail representations include `heartbeat`. Its fields are `status`
(`unknown`, `healthy`, `stale`, or `disconnected`), nullable UTC
`lastSuccessfulCommunicationAt`, Boolean `fresh`, numeric `staleAfterSeconds`, positive
session-scoped `sequence`, nullable `source` (`physical` or `simulated`), and `sessionId`.
The timestamp advances only for validated initialisation, probe reads (including a valid
not-inserted response), or battery reads. It resets to null after process restart; heartbeat
state is not persisted. Age is derived by clients rather than serialized.

Reconnect remains asynchronous. HTTP 202 confirms acceptance only: poll the returned operation,
then refetch the device and inspect heartbeat. Reconnect uses the existing connection state
machine and bypasses normal backoff. See [thermometer heartbeat](thermometer-heartbeat.md) for
complete semantics and examples.

`/health` is only liveness. With MQTT enabled, `/ready` returns 503 until the publisher connects.
Diagnostics contain safe codes rather than exception messages, host settings or credentials.

`GET /api/v1/events/stream` is a live-only SSE stream, not a replay endpoint.
See the [SSE guide](sse.md) for framing, event types, heartbeat comments,
reconnection and snapshot reconciliation. MQTT carries a different, flattened
payload; see the [MQTT guide](mqtt.md) before writing a subscriber.

After the stale threshold, probe and battery resources keep their last observation metadata but
return `fresh: false`; stale temperatures and battery percentages are returned as `null`.
