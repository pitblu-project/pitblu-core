# Architecture

Pitblu is split by responsibility: **pitblu-core owns the thermometer** and
**pitblu-app owns the cook**. Browsers, the permanent display, QR followers and
integrations consume pitblu-app's versioned API and application SSE stream. The
application obtains current hardware truth from pitblu-core REST, then consumes its
SSE stream and reconciles again after any reconnect. It never consumes core MQTT.

The cook database uses collections and identifies a physical source with the pair
`core device ID + probe channel`. Semantic measurements are linked to those sources
through time-bound assignments, so reassignment never rewrites old history. SQLite
persists cooks, cookers, foods, readings, events, alerts and follower capabilities.

The concrete `PitbluCoreClient` sits behind a thermometer-gateway boundary. A future
independent `pitblu-blower-core` can have its own hardware lifecycle, safety system,
watchdog and real-time control loop, with a separate app adapter. It is not part of
Milestone 1, and pitblu-core is not a generic hardware layer.

```

The API owns every capability; each UI is only a client.

`pitblu-app` is platform-neutral. It depends on network contracts, Python and its
own application database—not GPIO, BLE, BlueZ, ARM, Raspberry Pi OS, systemd or
pitblu-core's host filesystem. Running both services on one Pi is supported, but so
is running the application on any other host that can reach the gateway.

## Thermometer gateway internals

The remainder of this section describes pitblu-core specifically. Its authoritative target is a native, headless Raspberry Pi gateway with separate control and
telemetry planes. The v1.0.0 release implements both planes over the shared device boundary.

`DeviceAdapter` is the only device-facing boundary. The production and simulated V202 adapters
both implement asynchronous discovery, connection, disconnection and snapshot reads. Their shared
models carry one to four probe readings, battery state, UTC observation times, monotonic sequence
numbers and a physical or simulated source marker.

The discovery supervisor remains active but schedules finite scans. Its defaults are a five-second
scan, a 15-second interval while a device is missing and a 60-second background interval while an
adapter is connected. This is continuous supervision, not uninterrupted radio scanning.

Desired connection state is separate from the observed state. The observed states are discovered,
connecting, initialising, connected, polling, degraded, backoff, disconnected and unsupported.
Transitions are validated and repeated connect or disconnect requests are idempotent. The backoff
policy uses the 2, 4, 8, 15, 30 and 60-second schedule with plus or minus 20 per cent
jitter. Runtime recovery coordinates retries and stable-connection backoff reset.

FastAPI owns HTTP transport and generated OpenAPI. An administration service coordinates adapters
without coupling them to HTTP. SQLite contains registered devices, desired state, configuration
overrides, authentication hashes, secret values and bounded operation metadata. It never contains
temperature history. Live snapshots remain in memory.

Configuration precedence is default, YAML, environment and persisted override. A complete
Pydantic model validates the effective candidate before one SQLite transaction replaces persisted
overrides. Version ETags provide optimistic concurrency.

Authentication is optional only on loopback. Non-loopback binding requires bearer-token mode.
Only salted scrypt hashes are persisted for administrator tokens; rotation returns plaintext once.
Write-only integration secrets use dedicated endpoints and never appear in configuration or error
responses.

Successful snapshots enter `TelemetryState`, which owns current in-memory state and stale
deadlines. It emits immutable canonical events through a bounded `EventBus`. Recent REST history,
authenticated SSE subscribers and the optional MQTT publisher consume that same event type. Slow
subscribers have bounded queues and lose their oldest queued event rather than blocking device
sampling.

Thermometer communication is explicit adapter evidence, not a snapshot or timer side effect.
`TelemetryState` separately owns its session-scoped heartbeat and stale deadline. The layers are
process health, transport health, Bluetooth adapter, device connection, thermometer heartbeat and
probe freshness; each proves only the next narrower fact. Heartbeat ageing publishes state but
never initiates recovery. The administration service and connection state machine remain the sole
automatic-recovery owner. See the [heartbeat contract](thermometer-heartbeat.md).

The MQTT adapter maps canonical events onto the independent `v1` topic contract. All publications
use QoS 1. Availability, connection and battery state are retained; temperature is not. Service
availability is protected by a retained Last Will. MQTT is disabled by default and has no command
subscription path.

The runtime serialises adapter calls and reserves one adapter owner. Registered desired
connections recover with jittered backoff and protected identity matching. Read failures degrade
state before sustained failure triggers reconnect. Startup marks interrupted operations and
restores eligible registrations. Operational events, but not telemetry history, are bounded in
SQLite. MQTT independently retries and exposes safe status. Shutdown cancels workers, preserves
desired state and flushes offline retained publications. Native systemd deployment provides
dedicated-account execution and automatic process restart. See [installation](installation.md)
and the [integration guide](frontend-integration.md) for current constraints.

## Guided terminal boundary

`pitblu-core-install` is an unprivileged orchestration layer over the proven deployment script. It
classifies the host and Debian packages, obtains explicit consent before fixed `sudo apt-get`
commands, and invokes `deploy/manage.sh` without a shell command string or captured output. This
keeps the one-time bootstrap token on the operator's TTY. The source-checkout launcher supplies the
trusted source root before a package exists; installed launchers follow the managed `current`
release.

`pitblu-core-config` is also unprivileged and local-only. It talks to `127.0.0.1` through the public
REST contract rather than reading SQLite or configuration files. Mutations follow GET with ETag,
whole-model validation, PATCH, and the separate write-only secret endpoint where needed. Only a
confirmed service restart crosses the privilege boundary. Shared terminal code owns sanitisation,
hidden input, TTY detection, optional colour and PASS/WARN/FAIL presentation; it contains no
gateway business rules.

iGrill onboarding uses the existing scan operation, opaque discovery ID, registration and device
operation resources. MQTT and API prompts map only to existing typed settings. Add diagnostics by
returning `CheckResult` values and add configuration sections by extending the service schema first,
then presenting only that supported model in the CLI. Unit tests inject terminal input, host command
results and API clients. Final Bluetooth, restart/reboot, broker delivery and endurance behaviour
still require the separate Pi/iGrill acceptance gates.
