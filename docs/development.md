# Development

## Thermometer communication evidence

Device adapters must timestamp only recognised validated thermometer exchanges. Completed
model-specific authentication, decoded probe reads (including the absent sentinel), and decoded
battery reads count for the V202. Connection flags, timers, cached data and exceptions do not.
Populate `DeviceSnapshot.successful_communication_at` with the newest successful read in that
cycle; return initialisation evidence from `connect`. `TelemetryState` owns ageing and mappings.

Do not reconnect from telemetry or heartbeat code. Recovery remains in `AdministrationService`.
New adapters require success/failure/no-probe/simulation tests and must document their operations
in [the heartbeat guide](thermometer-heartbeat.md).

Use an isolated Python 3.11, 3.12 or 3.13 virtual environment. CI runs on all three
versions. The published release is v0.9.0; the current candidate is v1.0.0rc5.

## Setup and checks

From the repository root on Linux:

```bash
cd pitblu-core
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .
.venv/bin/python -m ruff format --check .
.venv/bin/python -m mypy src tests
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
bash -n deploy/manage.sh
```

On Windows, create the environment with `python -m venv .venv` and use
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe` for the Python commands. Shell syntax checking requires
Bash; native installation and Bluetooth acceptance run on the Pi, not Windows.
Do not run a diagnostic adapter alongside the installed service on the same device.

## Documentation checks

Follow the [documentation policy](README.md). The frontend inventory test checks
route, setting and event coverage; the documentation-link test checks local links.
Review semantics and examples as well: link coverage alone does not prove accuracy.

Hardware tests are manual and gated. Ordinary CI does not require Bluetooth hardware. New protocol
facts need sanitised evidence and an update to `docs/provenance.md`.

The deterministic simulator uses the production adapter models and is the default test double for
device-level behaviour. Tests may configure one to four probes, rising, falling or stable patterns,
probe presence, battery percentage, stale snapshots and connection availability without real-time
sleeps. Connection backoff accepts an injected random source so boundary values are deterministic.

Terminal-tool tests use injected input/output, command runners and loopback API clients. Keep
presentation in `terminal.py`, host/package checks in `system_checks.py`, HTTP details in
`api_client.py`, and workflow orchestration in the two CLI modules. Never add a token or password
argument for test convenience. New privileged commands must be fixed argument arrays and require a
specific user confirmation. See [ADR 0004](adr/0004-guided-terminal-tools.md).

The fixture under `tests/fixtures/v202/` contains only protocol payloads and manual display values
from directly observed protocol evidence. It must never contain a Bluetooth address or private network data.
The manual `pitblu-v202-check` command exercises the production adapter rather than the simulator.
