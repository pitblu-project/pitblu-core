# Physical acceptance and remaining release gates

Physical thermometer-heartbeat validation is pending. Automated implementation tests do not
prove real V202 initialisation/read evidence, no-probe behaviour, communication loss ageing,
forced reconnect during backoff, restart sessions, or retained MQTT interpretation on the Pi.
This remains v1.0.0 work and is not marked passed here.

The [v1.0.0rc1 partial Pi record](physical-candidate-rc1.md) documents successful
two-probe and absent-probe observations alongside a repeatable manual reconnect
failure. The next candidate must retest that failure.

The v0.9.0 runtime baseline was accepted as v0.9.0rc1 at revision f3bc114. The
final v0.9.0 preparation changes metadata and documentation only. The full v1.0.0
physical suite and minimum four-hour soak are **not complete**.

## Clean-Pi v0.9.0 evidence: recorded 10 September 2026

Clean installation at exact commit
`f3bc11488e72b966676c0f3a1844ea218259ab90` passed on a fresh Raspberry Pi OS
Lite 64-bit Trixie system. REST-only onboarding and connection, two available
probe/display comparisons at 0.0°C delta, absent-probe state, battery cadence,
SSE, MQTT security and payload behaviour, restart and reboot recovery, backup,
same-version upgrade/rollback and non-destructive uninstall/restoration all passed.
See the [clean-Pi record](clean-pi-acceptance.md) for the sanitised results.

## Candidate evidence: 8 September 2026

- Pi Python 3.13.5: 114 tests pass, 93.79% coverage; the preceding lint, format
  and strict typing checks completed successfully in the operator's command chain.
- Migration preserved the original administrator token and registered device state.
- Physical probes 1 and 2 returned fresh 19 degrees Celsius readings; channels 3
  and 4 reported absent; battery returned 50%. Display comparison remains unconfirmed.
- MQTT authenticated as pitblu-core and delivered retained service availability
  and non-retained physical temperatures on pitblu topics, all QoS 1.
- Reboot restored service, MQTT and physical polling automatically, NRestarts=0.
  Readiness returned 200; Bluetooth power and clock synchronisation reported true.
- A verified protected backup was created after migration and reboot acceptance.

These are historical operator-supplied results from the earlier existing-OS
migration. They remain useful evidence but are superseded for the v0.9.0
clean-install gate by the record above. Neither record constitutes four-inserted-
probe acceptance, independent penetration testing or a four-hour soak.

## v0.9.0 audit gates

The clean-Pi gate passed. Follow the [current audit plan](v0.9.0-plan.md) for final
documentation, provenance, CI and release review.

## v1.0.0 physical release checklist

Run against the final candidate, recording the exact revision and environment.
These remain final-candidate checks even where earlier milestones provide evidence.

- Discover the V202 within 20 seconds and register/connect through REST.
- Resolve expected Weber services and read all four inserted probe channels.
- Match each display within 1 degree Celsius; detect removal within 15 seconds;
  read battery; reject invalid/sentinel values.
- Mark stale data and publish service/device/probe availability correctly.
- Recover from iGrill power cycling, temporary Bluetooth failure, broker restart
  and Pi reboot without manual service restart.
- Verify REST operations, SSE, MQTT payloads/Last Will, configuration persistence,
  authentication, token rotation and secret redaction.
- Verify clean native installation, automatic startup, graceful shutdown, upgrade
  and rollback, with migration limitations stated explicitly.
- Pass supported-Python CI and complete documentation/provenance/licence reviews.
- Complete at least four hours of physical monitoring without manual intervention;
  record sample freshness, MQTT receipt, telemetry gaps, interruptions and automatic
  recovery. Review every gap; merely leaving the process running is not a pass.

## Safe test procedure and evidence

Arrange disruptive checks outside an active cook. Close competing thermometer apps
and run only one gateway against the physical device. Keep independent temperature
checks. Use small related batches of Pi commands and review results before proceeding.
Stop at hardware decisions requiring operator input.

Record dates, revision, OS/Python/BlueZ versions, steps, expected and actual outcomes,
manual display comparisons, timing and recovery details. Omit private addresses,
credentials and raw databases. Distinguish simulation from physical evidence.
A failed or unrun check stays failed or pending; a healthy endpoint alone is not a pass.
